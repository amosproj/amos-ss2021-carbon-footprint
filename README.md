# Carbon Footprint Visualization (AMOS SS 2021)

**Industry partner:** Falko Parthey, Siemens Energy

**Project Description**
The software to be developed shall visualize the carbon footprint of some
machinery / production environments (scenario) under different circumstances
(calculations). The scenarios (basic setup) and the calculations (use of different
materials for the scenario) are predefined and provided through an existing cloud
service API. The student team is to develop software that allows for
  ● Selection of scenarios and calculations
  ● Visualization of individual calculations
  ● Side-by-side comparison of different calculations
Target environments are laptops (browsers) and later tablets.
Open questions
  ● Multi-user support? I.e. can users store a work state of looking at data?
  
Project Constraints
  ● Core technologies:  Javascript or Typescript, web technologies
  ● Team language:      English
  ● Needed resources:   A cloud service with carbon footprint scenarios and pre-done calculations
